          <p style="color:white;font-size: 120%;line-height: 2;">While most celebrities try hard to make their faces recognizable, some decide to hide their identities. Satoshi Nakamoto (the creator of bitcoin), The Residents (a surrealist band), Banksy (world's top street artist), The Stig (an expert-level test driver) are all mysterious anonymities that hundreds of people make conjectures about their real faces. However, none of them are considered as females. The project aims to make a new conjecture for people who ignore the possibilities of females: The anonymous can be women.</p>

            Invisible Discrimination Against Women<br>
            As many feminism campaigns sweep the world, more and more people are aware of issues like gender equality, sexual harassment etc. However, not every discrimination is physical and visible. It's easy to ignore some mental discrimination against females-something invisible that even some women themselves fail to recognize. Bring an interactive experience, the art project intends to make the audience themselves realize the invisible discrimination in a spontaneous way.
            <br>
            <br>
            The project takes an interesting aspects-the anonymous. People love to make guesses about the mysterious celebrities who intentionally hide their identities. What interest me most is that, if we take a look at the top answers to these anonymous peopleâ€™s identities, none of them consider these celebrities as females. The creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, is considered as a 37 years old man living in Japan. Banksy, one of the world's top street artists, is regarded as a 28 white man. Similarly, people assume The Residents (a famous band), The Stig (the test driver for Top Gear) are all males. However, can women be genius in coding and business? Can women do graffiti on the street and tell the world their anger against wars and desires for peace? Can women play music or driver a F1 wildly? The answers are no doubt yes.
            <br>
            <br>
            What the project does is to present an image of the celebrity that people normally have and break that images by revealing a female body figure gradually. The audience moving their hands and slowly sweep the sand on the familiar male faces and gradually reveal the female body figures.

            Conjecture, Not Conjecture<br>
            The project does not intend to offer a good answer for the identities of these anonymous people. Reversely, it wants to provide more answers to the roles of women. Women can do things that we assume they cannot. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Though the project is still in progress, the woman figure already tells a lot of stories: a pregnant woman, a woman who smokes on the street or a woman who pick up kids from school can be a great role model in an industry, can be Banksy, can be Satoshi.
